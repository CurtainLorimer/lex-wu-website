My first bout at a podcast was ultimately a failure, but it taught me a lot of things. 

## Achievements
<ul>
- It was a podcast! <br>
- Wrote theme and transition music <br>
</ul>
That's it. There's more to the story.

## Hosting + Writing

I'd never written for a podcast before, and I'd also never hosted a podcast before. 

## Web Development

The website (since taken down) was a simple WordPress-based website based on <a href="https://wordpress.com/theme/twentyfifteen">Twenty Fifteen</a>

## Branding

Bold colours and a simple wordmark. Ultimately not my best design, but one that stood the test of time (and almost ended up becoming the inspiration for a soundtrack for a short film). 

## Final Remarks

Please don't use this as your basis of my portfolio. I've taken lessons from this little experiment and used it to write [Here's a Minute](http://lexwu.com/work/curtain-lorimer/heres-a-minute) with my friend Vian Vera. And I'm also significantly better as [a composer and producer now.](https://lwumusic.com)
