I thought it'd be fun to try a podcast again - so I decided to start one with a friend.

## Achievements
<ul>
- Created a website <br>
- Composed and produced a custom soundtrack for use every other week <br>
</ul>

## Hosting + Writing

Obviously, any podcast wouldn't be a podcast without a host (or two) to walk people through an audio presentation.
That would be me! Vian and I come up with the prompts, and hopefully you'll listen too!

## Web Development

As a freelance web developer, I used [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to get these websites up 
and running for the holiday season (also known as: getting websites done within three days of notice.) 

## Branding

Simple and elegant. That's what I usually go with. 

At least for the album, I was in charge of making the album art. A stopwatch and bold text was how we wanted to make it work. Colours were chosen for the pop factor, and everything else was just whatever came to mind. And I think it looks great.

## Music
Since the last time I had to compose music for a podcast, I've bettered myself as a musician. 

In terms of music direction, I've gone for an Animal Crossing-esque vibe with the instrumentation of a small jazz band. 
I'm not trying to make meditation music, but I'm also not trying to go too wild with the music. It'll be out on Spotify (soon).

Take a look at the EP of music I've composed specifically as backdrop music for this podcast soon - it'll be releasing by the end of January!
