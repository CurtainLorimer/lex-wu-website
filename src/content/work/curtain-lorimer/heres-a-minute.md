I thought it'd be fun to try a podcast again - so I decided to start one with a friend.

## Hosting + Writing

Obviously, any podcast wouldn't be a podcast without a host (or two) to walk people through an audio presentation. That would be me! Jayden and I come up with the prompts, and hopefully you'll listen too!

## Web Development

As a freelance web developer, I used [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to get these websites up and running for the holiday season (also known as: getting websites done within three days of notice.)

## Music

Since the last time I had to compose music for a podcast, I've bettered myself as a musician. Take a look at the album of music I've composed specifically as backdrop music for this podcast - it's a lot!

## Branding

Simple and elegant. That's what I usually go with.
