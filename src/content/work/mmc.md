Yep, that's us. (Photo by Skye Turrietta, by the way.) You're probably wondering how we got here.

## Achievements
<ul>
- Co-wrote the short film "Backstage" with two other writers
- Co-wrote short film codenamed "Ghost Shenanigans" with another writer
- Contributed to development of short film "Shoe"
- Acted as an extra in each film
</ul>

## Backstage
As one of three writers, I contributed to scheduling everything out (even though we ended up going overtime - whoops!) Though I can't release the short film (it hasn't been released, and is not slated for public release), I can say it's some of the best work this club has ever done, and the closest we've got to actually releasing a film. 

## Shoe
This was the first film the club ever tried making. It focused on a janitor with anger management issues, and included someone dying falling down the stairs. (I’m butchering the summary in case any of us want to revive it.) We never released it (due to a bunch of factors, such as us not establishing a rigid filming schedule – but that’s not the point).

I tried contributing music to this. Though it was never released (and therefore, nothing will ever be uttered about this topic henceforth), the spirit of Shoe lives on in my podcast [Here's a Minute](/curtain-lorimer/heres-a-minute), where the music lives on.

The only thing you'll ever hear about this project is that we were slated to throw someone down the stairs. Participating in this short film was fun – even if we never got to finish it.

The music was just something I tried on the side. I never really expected any of it to be selected for the final film. I'll attach the chess theme, but for more, [you should probably visit my music website!](https://lwumusic.com)
