					<p>
						As a musician, I've been playing the piano for about 10 years and started songwriting 
						about 2 years ago. I've also picked up a lot of skills during that time.
					</p>
					<p>
						In an effort to make sure that I'm able to control everything I make, I then picked up a lot of skills.
					</p>
					<p>
						Web development was something I picked up so I could design my own websites and make my own designs for albums.
						Making everything uniquely me was something I've always worked on - and by working on it myself, I'm able to keep everything
						tailored exclusively towards myself.
					</p>
					<p>
						Writing was something I took up so I could write short films that incorporate my music - i.e. like a musical. I've even
						worked on writing podcasts for the masses.
